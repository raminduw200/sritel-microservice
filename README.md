# Sri-Tel - Middleware Architectures Project

## Sri Tel Ltd Customer Experience Prototype

Welcome to the Middleware Architectures project for Sri Tel Ltd (STL) - New Customer Experience Prototype. This initiative is dedicated to developing a technology solution that employs middleware architectures and related technologies to enhance the customer experience within STL's telecommunications services.

### Project Overview

In this collaborative project, our goal is to design and implement a prototype solution for a specific business scenario presented by STL. The solution will incorporate the principles of middleware architecture and utilize open-source technologies.

### Scenario: Sri Tel Ltd (STL)

STL, a leading telecommunications provider in Sri Lanka, is focused on improving its customer care and experience. The management aims to draw in new customers by introducing a state-of-the-art Internet-based Customer Care Web Portal, known as "Sri-Care," together with companion iOS and Android smartphone applications. These new platforms are intended to provide customers with the convenience of managing their services effortlessly.

#### Key Features of the Prototype

The prototype we are developing will encompass several essential features, such as:
- Enabling the activation and deactivation of Telco services, such as international roaming and Value-Added Services (VAS).
- Providing access to view current and historical billing information.
- Facilitating online payment transactions using credit and debit cards.
